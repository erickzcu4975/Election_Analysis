#Election Audit Summary
Highly recomend scrip for making election audit, the scrip on Python thru Visual code has 106 lines, very compact. Thru this we could get:
1. total number of votes cast. 
2. total number of votes each candidate received, and the percentage
3. winner of the election
4. result by county in total and percetage of votes
5. weighting each county on the election result.
6. Even when Python is hard for beginners, it's very logical, and effective given that it's very similar to the spoken/written human language.
